## Architectural Basics

# How many layers

# 3x3 Convolutions

# MaxPooling

# Position of MaxPooling

# The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction

# Concept of Transition Layers,

# Position of Transition Layer

# 1x1 Convolutions

# Receptive Field

# SoftMax

# When to add validation checks

# Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels

# Batch Normalization

# Image Normalization

# The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction

# DropOut
If your model is overfitting then add the dropout, have added dropout in my second model to overcome the overfitting

# When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting


# Learning Rate

# Number of Epochs and when to increase them
To tarain the model more increase the number of epochs, increased the no of epochs to 20 in  my third model

# LR schedule and concept behind it

# Batch Size, and effects of batch size
Increase the batch size once you are close to your target accuracy to increase the compution of your model, increased the batch size to 64 in my fourth model
